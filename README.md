Odin Project: Recipes

This is my first project. Please bear with me.
These webpages were created to demonstrate fundamental knowlege of HTML. 
There are three recepies linked together by an index/home page. 
If you make the osso buco, be sure to eat it with a bottle of Barolo. 
Will google how to make a good readme now.
